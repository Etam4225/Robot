						+ "objective is to move the payload to a delivery point, while the Defenders must halt the Attackers' progress until "
						+ "time runs out. Assault is a Game Mode in which the Attacking and Defending teams must attempt to take or defend "

						+ "The attackers' goal is to capture critical objectives, while the defenders must maintain control over them until "
						+ "time runs out. Hybrid Game Mode starts with an Assault and ends with an Escort section. These two parts behave "
						+ "exactly as their stand-alone Game Modes do. On Control maps, two teams fight over a series of objective areas in "
						+ "a best-of-three format. When a team is in control of the roundâ€™s objective area, they will make progress toward "
						+ "capturing it, and whichever team gets to 100% first wins the round. Each round (up to 3 total) will feature a new "
						+ "objective area located in a different part of the map.");
